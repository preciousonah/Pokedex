# Pokedex

# Your Challenge

You will need to create a pokedex with the help of an API. We know that already exists a lot of versions of it but, we want you to create a version of your own with a personal touch. We are interested in your creativity and the way you write code. Using React would be great. It doesn't have to be perfect, that's why we will not put so much attention on how it looks but it has to work properly.

## Requirements

- Use this API https://pokeapi.co/ to get the data for what you need.
- Create a React-based application.

### Application Requirements:
- Allow users to create an account and log in (using any backend technology).
- A list page of all pokemon.
- A pokemon detail page, showing a user all the pokemon goodness:
    - Image of the pokemon [hint: this can be found in one of the API responses, look for sprite information].
    - A description.
    - Choose some of its characteristics like: Stats, Abilities, Movements etc ... maximum 5.
- An option to search from the list page, where we can search for different pokemons and show the result.
- You can use whatever UI library you prefer if it will be easy to build the site.
- The code can be sent via github.
